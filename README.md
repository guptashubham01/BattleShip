# BattleShip

This is a python game to guess the existence of the ship by guessing the row and column on the game board.

##Further Enhancements

    * Make multiple battleships: need to be careful to not place battleships on top of each other on the game board. Also need to make sure that the size of the board is balanced with the number of ships so the game is still challenging and fun to play.

    * Make battleships of different sizes: this is trickier than it sounds. All the parts of the battleship need to be vertically or horizontally touching and make sure not to accidentally place part of a ship off the side of the board.

    * Make the game a two-player game.

    * Use functions to allow the game to have more features like rematches, statistics and more!
